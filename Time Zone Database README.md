5. Time Zone Database

 ,,® gerrit foundation org 

 ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.

 # 7.  Database Ownership
 #
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

[![Build GitHub Docs On Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/?repo=github)

This repository contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com).

GitHub's Docs team works on pre-production content in a private repo that regularly syncs with this public repo.

## Contributing

We accept different types of contributions, including some that don't require you to write a single line of code. For detailed instructions on how to get started with our project, see "[About contributing to GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/about-contributing-to-github-docs)."

### Ways to contribute
